An inquiring mind with a predilection for technology, I have taken to studying various aspects of software development. These are the things I have created along the way - my portfolio, if you will.

[I'm Stephen Mather. I love developing software. I've created things using Python, Django, HTML and CSS - you can see some of them here. I'm currently taking a look at Swift.]

Software Developer

My name is Stephen Mather. I am a software developer. I haven't quite hit my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_%28book%29">10,000 hours</a> yet, but I endeavour to keep racking them up each and every day. This site is a showcase for the things I create: solutions to problems; manifestations of random ideas; the products of assignments from my studies.

Coding aside, I am well versed in the ways of Linux and I know a thing or two about using Git for version control.

[Endeavouring to reach my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_%28book%29">10,000 hours</a> and beyond, I'm constantly tinkering with something. This site is a showcase for the things I create: solutions to problems; manifestations of random ideas; the products of assignments from my studies.

I have experience developing full stack Web solutions, command line utilities and sys admin scripts. Coding aside, I know a thing or two about using Git for version control and I am well versed in the ways of Linux.]


Education

I am self taught, with a little help along the way from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udacity">Udacity</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun">Mr Thrun</a> and co, I commend you - your creation is a wonderful resource. With Udacity I am not only learning how to write code, but getting real insight into the theory and concepts of computer science.

I have completed <a href="http://www.udacity.com/course/cs101">CS101: Intro to Computer Science</a>, gaining a <a href="education/cs101-certificate.pdf">verified certificate of completion</a> for the course. I received <a href="education/cs101-evaluation.pdf">very positive feedback</a> for my final project, which can be found on <a href="http://gist.github.com/justsostephen/490d886f6763bfe928ea">GitHub</a>. I have also completed <a href="http://www.udacity.com/course/ud036">UD036: Programming Foundations with Python</a>, however as this seemed somewhat supplementary to CS101, I couldn't justify the cost of the verified certification. I am currently studying <a href="http://www.udacity.com/course/cs212">CS212: Design of Computer Programs</a> and intend to enrol in a <a href="http://www.udacity.com/nanodegree">Nanodegree</a> in the near future.
